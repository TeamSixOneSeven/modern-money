# Modern Money

_Modern Money_ is an engineering-driven meta-research project on the current state of the art of _trustless payment systems_ such as Bitcoin. The purpose is to structure a library of knowledge about cryptocurrencies to provide an overview of the most urgent challenges, their solutions and the status of implementation.

## Overview
There are two main chapters:
1. [__Evolution of Money:__](/evolution-of-money/readme.md) The historic background of money and crypto currency.
2. [__Crypto Currency:__](/crypto-currency/readme.md) The current challenges and future solutions.  

The first chapter provides the background to understand the motivation and vision of cryptocurrency and the second chapter is an in-depth analysis of the current state of the art.
